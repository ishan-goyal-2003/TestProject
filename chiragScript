You know Without proper documentation, new developers struggle to understand how the 

API works, leading to wasted time searching through code, asking multiple questions, and making assumptions,

which often result in delays and misunderstandings.
 
External teams or clients integrating with our API face

similar challenges—without clear instructions on available endpoints, request formats, and authentication

requirements, they may send incorrect data, leading to failed requests and unnecessary troubleshooting.
 
These issues arise because manual documentation is often outdated, inconsistent, or difficult to maintain 

as the system evolves.
 
To address these concerns, we implemented OpenAPI using Swagger UI, which generates API documentation 

directly from the source code, ensuring accuracy, automatic updates, and accessibility through a web 

interface (/swagger-ui.html).
 
The benefits of this approach are developers can visually explore API 

endpoints without guesswork.
 
New team members onboard faster, clients integrate more smoothly with clear 

request and response structures.
 
By implementing OpenAPI, we have created a 

structured, efficient, and scalable system that enhances developer productivity, ensures API clarity, 

and simplifies integration for both internal and external teams, supporting long-term stability and 

usability.
 
Now, I’ll hand it over to Survesh, who will explain the technical implementation in more detail.
